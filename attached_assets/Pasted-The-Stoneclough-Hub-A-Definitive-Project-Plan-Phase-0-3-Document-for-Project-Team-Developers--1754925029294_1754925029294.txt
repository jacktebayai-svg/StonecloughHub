The Stoneclough Hub: A Definitive Project Plan (Phase 0 - 3)
Document for: Project Team, Developers, Investors, and Partners
Project: The Stoneclough Hub
Version: 2.0
Status: Live Development Plan
1.0 Project Overview & Guiding Principles
Vision: To build a self-sustaining, data-driven platform that empowers local communities with transparent information and provides local businesses with a trusted, effective channel for growth.
Mission: Launch The Stoneclough Hub as the definitive source of local data and community connection, creating a repeatable blueprint for digital community empowerment.
Guiding Principles:
 * Community-First: All public-facing decisions prioritize community value and trust.
 * Data-Driven: All insights and business decisions are based on verifiable data.
 * Automation-Centric: Build for scale by automating as much of the data collection and content creation as possible.
 * Brutal Clarity: Maintain a ruthless focus on high-leverage activities and a clear, profitable monetization model.
Phase 0: The Foundation (Pre-Launch & Preparation)
Duration: 1-2 Months
Objective: Establish the legal, technical, and strategic foundations required for a successful launch. This phase is about meticulous planning and minimizing risk.
0.1 Legal & Compliance
 * Action: Consult with a legal professional specializing in digital media and data.
 * Focus:
 * Data Usage: Confirm the lawful use of public data from data.bolton.gov.uk under the Open Government Licence. Clarify what can be scraped, stored, and re-published.
 * Terms of Service & Privacy Policy: Draft comprehensive documents for the website, outlining user data collection, content usage, and business directory rules.
 * Trademarks: Secure the name "The Stoneclough Hub" and related branding.
0.2 Technical Infrastructure Setup
 * Action: Purchase and configure all necessary digital assets.
 * Focus:
 * Domain & Hosting: Secure stonecloughhub.co.uk and a scalable cloud hosting solution (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean).
 * Initial Tech Stack: Set up a foundational development environment. Recommend Python for the backend (with Django/FastAPI) and a modern JavaScript framework (React/Vue) for the frontend.
 * Database: Configure a robust database instance (PostgreSQL is recommended).
0.3 Initial Data Strategy & Scraping PoC
 * Action: Develop a Proof of Concept (PoC) for the data pipeline.
 * Focus:
 * Data Set Prioritization: Identify the 3-5 most impactful and accessible data sets from data.bolton.gov.uk to target first (e.g., planning applications, council meeting summaries, business rates data).
 * PoC Development: Build a simple Python script using Scrapy or BeautifulSoup to successfully crawl, scrape, and store a small sample of this data into a local database. This proves the core technical feasibility.
 * API Check: Perform a thorough search for any official APIs that could provide data more cleanly than scraping.
0.4 Team & Roles
 * Action: Define the initial team structure.
 * Focus:
 * Founder: Strategic vision, community engagement, and marketing.
 * Lead Developer (Contract): Responsible for building the MVP and establishing the data pipeline.
 * Content & Community Manager (Part-Time): Initially handled by the founder, this role will eventually be delegated to manage the forum and blog.
Phase 1: The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Launch
Duration: 3-4 Months
Objective: Launch a high-value, non-monetized platform to build initial community trust, gain an audience, and establish the brand as a credible authority.
1.1 Technical Development

 * Community Data Dashboard (MVP): Deploy a functional dashboard with the initial 3-5 data sets, featuring basic charts and a search function.
 * Business Index (Free Tier Only): A fully functional directory with free listings for all local businesses. This will be manually populated initially with public data, then opened to businesses to claim their listing.
 * Community Forum: A simple, moderated forum for discussion.
1.2 Content & Community Engagement
 * Action: Create the initial content pipeline and start building an audience.
 * Focus:
 * Blog Content: Publish 3-5 initial blog posts that are data-driven and community-centric (e.g., "An Audit of Local Road Maintenance Spending," "A Guide to Attending Your First Council Meeting").
 * Onboarding: Create a simple onboarding guide for the forum and business index.
 * Outreach: Announce the launch via social media, local press contacts, and direct outreach to local community groups. Position the Hub as a "public service project."
1.3 Launch & Growth
 * Action: Go live and focus on user acquisition.
 * Focus:
 * Launch Event: Host a small, in-person or online launch event to generate buzz.
 * User Feedback Loop: Collect feedback from early adopters via surveys and the forum to inform Phase 2 development.
 * Key Metric: Focus on website traffic, forum engagement, and the number of claimed business listings.
Phase 2: Monetization & Feature Expansion
Duration: 6 Months
Objective: Implement the revenue model, introduce paid products, and start generating revenue to make the project self-sustaining.
2.1 Monetization Implementation
 * Action: Roll out the tiered business directory and the first data product.
 * Focus:

 * Automation Refinement: Fine-tune the scraper to cover a wider range of high-value data sets.
2.3 Marketing & Sales
 * Action: Shift marketing from pure community value to a hybrid of community and business value.
 * Focus:
 * Content Marketing: Publish blog posts that appeal to both residents (e.g., "The Best Local Cafes for Remote Work") and business owners (e.g., "5 Ways to Attract More Customers to Your High Street Shop").
 * Case Studies: Create case studies of the first paying businesses in the directory, highlighting their success.
 * Key Metric: Focus on MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue), number of Premium/Elite listings, and new user signups.
Phase 3: Scaling, Replication, and Future Vision

The Stoneclough Hub: A Blueprint for a Community-First, Profit-Forward Ecosystem
Confidential Document for Investors & Developers
Prepared by: Gemini, as your strategic AI partner
Project: The Stoneclough Hub
Version: 1.0
1.0 Executive Summary
The Stoneclough Hub is a dual-purpose, data-driven digital platform designed to solve two distinct yet interconnected problems: the lack of accessible local government information for residents and the absence of effective, data-backed marketing for small businesses.
This document outlines a plan to build and launch a hyper-local, replicable ecosystem centered around a community-first website. By leveraging automated data crawling and scraping of public council data, we will become the sole provider of transparent, digestible information and a trusted voice for the community. This trust is the foundational asset we will monetize through a tiered business directory and premium data-as-a-service (DaaS) products.
The ultimate vision is to create a profitable, self-sustaining model that can be replicated in other communities, positioning the founder as a leader in both local digital platforms and community empowerment.
2.0 Vision and Core Problem Statement
2.1 The Problem: A Tale of Two Disconnects
 * Community Disconnect: Residents are disengaged from local governance due to inaccessible, jargon-filled public data. They lack a unified platform to voice concerns, engage in surveys, or organize for collective action.
 * Business Disconnect: Small, local businesses operate in a vacuum. They struggle to find new customers, lack access to local market intelligence, and have limited avenues to build trust and authority within their community.
2.2 The Solution: The Stoneclough Hub
The Hub is the bridge that connects these two worlds. It is a single platform built on the principle of information asymmetry. We will create and own the primary source of truth for the community, and in doing so, we will build a trusted channel that local businesses will pay a premium to access. The founder's established reputation in both the aesthetics business and community organizing provides a unique, unassailable foundation of credibility.
3.0 Platform Architecture & Key Features
The platform will be built on a modern, scalable technology stack to ensure performance and future growth.
3.1 The Front-End (The Community-First Persona)
The website will have a clean, professional, and intuitive design, mirroring a trustworthy journalistic or non-profit organization.
 * Community Data Dashboard (The Hero Feature):
 * Functionality: An interactive, visually-rich dashboard that presents live, public data from Bolton Council in easy-to-understand charts, graphs, and maps.
 * Data Sources: Planning applications, council meeting minutes, financial spending reports, local crime statistics, and key performance indicators (KPIs) from the data.bolton.gov.uk portal.
 * User Interface: Users can filter data by date, category, and location. Every data point will be accompanied by a clear, simple explanation and a link to the original source for transparency.
 * "Our Voice" Survey Hub:
 * Functionality: A tool to create, manage, and analyze community-wide surveys.
 * User Interaction: Residents can take surveys, view live results, and subscribe to notifications for new polls.
 * Business Index & Directory:
 * Functionality: A comprehensive index of local businesses with advanced search and filtering capabilities.
 * Key Differentiator: Listings will be tied to community engagement and a "Community Vetted" badge, building trust beyond a simple review score.
 * Community Forum & Blog:
 * Forum: A moderated discussion board for residents to post questions, share recommendations, and organize local initiatives.
 * Blog: Features data-driven reports, community news, and expert articles written to build authority, not to hard-sell.
3.2 The Back-End (The Data Engine)
This is the non-visible technology that powers the entire ecosystem.
 * Data Pipeline: The core of the platform is an automated, scheduled data pipeline.
 * Source: Bolton Council Open Data Portal (data.bolton.gov.uk), council website public pages, and other relevant public data sets.
 * Crawler & Scraper: A Python-based crawler (e.g., using Scrapy) will systematically navigate specified data sources. A scraper (e.g., using BeautifulSoup) will then extract and normalize the raw data.
 * Data Cleaning & Validation: An automated script will clean the extracted data, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and flagging anomalies.
 * Database: Clean data will be stored in a robust relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for easy querying and long-term analysis.
 * Analytics: A dedicated analytics module will perform audits and identify trends, discrepancies, and key insights.
 * Technology Stack Recommendations:
 * Backend: Python with the Django or FastAPI framework for scalability and rapid development.
 * Frontend: React or Vue.js for a dynamic, modern user experience.
 * Hosting: Cloud-based solution like AWS or Google Cloud to ensure reliability and scalability.
4.0 Monetization & Business Model
The revenue model is built on leveraging the trust and data generated by the community initiative.
 * Tiered Business Directory:
 * Tier 1: Basic Listing (Free): Name, address, and phone number. This rapidly populates the directory and reinforces its value as a comprehensive community resource.
 * Tier 2: Premium Listing (£X/month): All basic features, plus a detailed business description, images, logo, a link to the business website, and a "Community Vetted" badge. This is the core revenue driver.
 * Tier 3: Elite Listing (£XX/month): All premium features, plus exclusive access to a private dashboard with anonymized data from the "Our Voice" surveys and market insights derived from the data pipeline.
 * Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) - Insights Reports:
 * Product: Curated, quarterly "Stoneclough Community Insights Reports" sold as a one-time purchase or subscription.
 * Clients: Local government, real estate developers, larger regional businesses, and non-profits seeking to understand local trends.
 * Sponsored Content & Partnerships:
 * Product: A limited number of sponsored blog posts or advertising slots for businesses that align with the community's values.
5.0 Synergistic Strategy & Competitive Advantage
 * The Virtuous Cycle: The data engine provides value to the community, which builds trust. This trust drives engagement with the business directory. Revenue from the directory funds the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the community hub, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem.
 * Unassailable Authority: The founder's dual role as a business owner and community leader provides a unique level of credibility that no competitor can replicate. The platform is not an anonymous entity; it is a direct extension of a trusted local figure.
 * First-Mover Advantage: By being the first to create such a platform in Stoneclough, we will own the digital conversation and data flow for the community, making it nearly impossible for a new entrant to compete.
6.0 Phased Rollout Plan
 * Phase 1 (Initial Build & MVP - 3 Months):
 * Develop the core data pipeline to scrape and visualize public council data.
 * Launch the website with the Community Data Dashboard, the "Our Voice" Survey Hub, and the Free Basic Business Listings.
 * Actively engage the community and populate the initial directory.
 * Phase 2 (Monetization - 3-6 Months):
 * Introduce the Premium and Elite directory tiers.
 * Begin selling the first "Community Insights Report."
 * Utilize the founder’s aesthetics business as the first showcase for the Premium listing's value.
 * Phase 3 (Scaling & Replication - 6-12+ Months):
 * Expand features based on community feedback.
 * Create a "playbook" for replicating the Stoneclough Hub model in other local communities.
 * Explore franchising or licensing opportunities for the platform and data model.
Conclusion: The Stoneclough Hub is more than a website; it is a strategic business built on a foundation of genuine community value. By leveraging technology to solve a real-world problem, we will create a defensible, scalable, and highly profitable enterprise that simultaneously generates significant social impact.
