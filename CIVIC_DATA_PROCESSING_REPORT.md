## Technical Architecture

### Processing Pipeline
1. **Raw Data Ingestion**: Reads from `scraped_data/` and `focused-bolton-data/`
2. **Schema Validation**: Uses Zod schemas for type safety
3. **Data Transformation**: Extracts structured information from HTML content
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of malformed or incomplete data
5. **JSON Output**: Structured datasets ready for API consumption

### Data Models
- **Councillor**: Name, contact info, ward, party affiliation
- **Meeting**: Title, date, committee, status, attendees, decisions
- **Service**: Name, description, department, category, online availability
- **Statistics**: Category-based metrics with temporal data
- **Raw Pages**: URL, title, description, content analysis, quality scores

## Next Steps Completed

✅ **Data Processing Pipeline**: Successfully built and executed  
✅ **API Integration**: Processed data ready for database loading  

## Remaining Development Tasks

The processed civic data is now ready for integration into the StonecloughHub application:

1. **Database Integration**: Load processed JSON data into the application database
2. **API Endpoints**: Serve structured data through REST APIs
3. **Frontend Components**: Build UI components for civic data display
4. **Search & Filtering**: Implement search across all civic data types
5. **Visualization Dashboards**: Create Chart.js dashboards for civic metrics

## Data Usage Recommendations

- **Services Data**: Ideal for creating a service directory with online/offline status
