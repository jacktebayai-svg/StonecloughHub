## 🚨 Important Notes

### Data Privacy & Ethics
- **Public data only**: System processes only publicly available council information
- **Transparency focused**: Enhances public access to government information
- **Contact verification**: All contact details are from official council sources

### Performance Considerations  
- **Large datasets**: Can process 10,000+ records efficiently
- **Incremental updates**: Only reprocesses changed/new data
- **Memory optimization**: Processes data in configurable batches
- **Storage efficient**: Compressed JSON output with optional CSV exports

### Error Handling
- **Graceful degradation**: Continues processing if individual records fail
- **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed error reports and recommendations
- **Recovery mechanisms**: Can resume from interruption points
- **Quality validation**: Skips low-quality data with explanations

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No data found"**
```bash
# Ensure database is populated first
npm run db:seed

# Check if crawler has run
npx tsx server/services/master-unified-crawler.ts
```

**"Missing ward data"**  
- The system creates placeholders for wards with no data
- Check the recommendations for specific data collection priorities
- Ward boundaries are mapped to Bolton Council's official 21 wards

**"Outdated financial data"**
- System automatically filters data older than 3 years
- High-value transactions (>£100k) are retained regardless of age
- Use the freshness analysis to prioritize new data collection

### Performance Optimization
```bash
# For large datasets, run in stages:
npm run reprocess                    # Step 1: Process data
npm run visualize                   # Step 2: Generate reports
npm run pipeline:status             # Step 3: Check results
```
